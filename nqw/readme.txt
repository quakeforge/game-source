Single Player Game for ZQuake, v.0.04 --- README

It is highly recommended that you use this mod with ZQuake (zquake.exe
or zquake-gl.exe), otherwise there will be some problems because QW 2.30
doesn't fully support single player games.

Installing:

Just unpack the contents of this archive into your quake/qw folder
(spprogs.dat is the only file really needed).
Start ZQuake, press Esc to open the menu, choose "Single player", "New Game"
and enjoy.

You can download ZQuake at http://zquake.frag.ru/ (or http://zquake.da.ru)
